title: AddCell
summary: AddCell’s CRISPR-edited cell lines database is the most comprehensive of its kind, featuring detailed information on more than 6,000 cell lines and growing daily. In addition, the database covers a wide range of cell types from different organisms, including human, mouse, and rat cells. It includes information on gene characteristics, such as functional and biological functions and disease associations. The algorithm behind the search engine is based on a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The algorithm developed within a master thesis project at the Chalmers University of Technology. The thesis is available [**here**](https://odr.chalmers.se/server/api/core/bitstreams/4e0d5aaa-0c6b-4d28-8d6d-a8825690bc43/content).

AddCell’s CRISPR-edited cell lines database is the most comprehensive of its kind, featuring detailed information on more than 6,000 cell lines and growing daily. In addition, the database covers a wide range of cell types from different organisms, including human, mouse, and rat cells. It includes information on gene characteristics, such as functional and biological functions and disease associations. All this information is available to the research community, legislators, regulators, and the general public, making AddCell a valuable resource for anyone interested in CRISPR-edited cell lines. Check out [**AddCell's website**](https://addcell.org/) or [**project's Linkedin page**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/addcell/) for more information about this project.

In this project we developed a web application that allows users to search for CRISPR-edited cell lines by gene, cell type, disease, and other characteristics. The algorithm behind the search engine is based on a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The algorithm developed within a master thesis project at the Chalmers University of Technology. The thesis is available [**here**](https://odr.chalmers.se/server/api/core/bitstreams/4e0d5aaa-0c6b-4d28-8d6d-a8825690bc43/content).
