abstract: 'Deregulation of the protein secretory pathway (PSP) is linked to many hallmarks
  of cancer, such as promoting tissue invasion and modulating cell-cell signaling.
  The collection of secreted proteins processed by the PSP, known as the secretome,
  is often studied due to its potential as a reservoir of tumor biomarkers. However,
  there has been less focus on the protein components of the secretory machinery itself.
  We therefore investigated the expression changes in secretory pathway components
  across many different cancer types. Specifically, we implemented a dual approach
  involving differential expression analysis and machine learning to identify PSP
  genes whose expression was associated with key tumor characteristics: mutation of
  p53, cancer status, and tumor stage. Eight different machine learning algorithms
  were included in the analysis to enable comparison between methods and to focus
  on signals that were robust to algorithm type. The machine learning approach was
  validated by identifying PSP genes known to be regulated by p53, and even outperformed
  the differential expression analysis approach. Among the different analysis methods
  and cancer types, the kinesin family members KIF20A and KIF23 were consistently
  among the top genes associated with malignant transformation or tumor stage. However,
  unlike most cancer types which exhibited elevated KIF20A expression that remained
  relatively constant across tumor stages, renal carcinomas displayed a more gradual
  increase that continued with increasing disease severity. Collectively, our study
  demonstrates the complementary nature of a combined differential expression and
  machine learning approach for analyzing gene expression data, and highlights key
  PSP components relevant to features of tumor pathophysiology that may constitute
  potential therapeutic targets.'
