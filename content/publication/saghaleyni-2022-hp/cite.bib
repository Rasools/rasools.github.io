 abstract = {Recombinant protein production can cause severe stress on
cellular metabolism, resulting in limited titer and product
quality. To investigate cellular and metabolic characteristics
associated with these limitations, we compare HEK293 clones
producing either erythropoietin (EPO) (secretory) or GFP
(non-secretory) protein at different rates. Transcriptomic and
functional analyses indicate significantly higher metabolism and
oxidative phosphorylation in EPO producers compared with parental
and GFP cells. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibit specific
expression patterns depending on the recombinant protein and the
production rate. In a clone displaying a dramatically increased
EPO secretion, we detect higher gene expression related to
negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
including upregulation of ATF6B, which aids EPO production in a
subset of clones by overexpression or small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown. Our results offer potential target pathways
and genes for further development of the secretory power in
mammalian cell factories.},
