abstract: Recombinant protein production can cause severe stress on cellular metabolism,
  resulting in limited titer and product quality. To investigate cellular and metabolic
  characteristics associated with these limitations, we compare HEK293 clones producing
  either erythropoietin (EPO) (secretory) or GFP (non-secretory) protein at different
  rates. Transcriptomic and functional analyses indicate significantly higher metabolism
  and oxidative phosphorylation in EPO producers compared with parental and GFP cells.
  In addition, ribosomal genes exhibit specific expression patterns depending on the
  recombinant protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying a dramatically
  increased EPO secretion, we detect higher gene expression related to negative regulation
  of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including upregulation of ATF6B, which aids
  EPO production in a subset of clones by overexpression or small interfering RNA
  (siRNA) knockdown. Our results offer potential target pathways and genes for further
  development of the secretory power in mammalian cell factories.
