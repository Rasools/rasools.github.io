abstract: Summary Higher eukaryotic cell lines like HEK293 are the preferred hosts
  for production of therapeutic proteins requiring human post translational processing.
  However, recombinant protein production can result in severe stress on the cellular
  machinery, resulting in limited titre and product quality. To investigate the cellular
  and metabolic characteristics associated with these limitations, we compared erythropoietin
  (secretory) and GFP (non-secretory) protein producer HEK293 cell-lines using transcriptomics
  analysis. Despite the high demand for ATP in all protein producer clones, a significantly
  higher capacity for ATP production was observed with erythropoietin producers as
  evidenced by the enrichment of upregulated genes in the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibited specific patterns of expression
  depending on the recombinant protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying
  a dramatically increased erythropoietin secretion, we detected higher ER stress,
  including upregulation of the ATF6B gene. Our results are significant in recognizing
  key pathways for recombinant protein production and identifying potential target
  genes for further development of secretory power in mammalian cell factories.In
  Brief Although the protein secretion process has been widely studied, the complexity
  of it leaves many questions with regards to defining bottlenecks for successful
  protein secretion to be answered. By investigating the transcriptomic profiles of
  different HEK293 clones with varying translational rates producing either the secreted
  protein erythropoietin or the intracellular GFP, we reveal that high ATP production
  and improved capacity of specific post-translational pathways are key factors associated
  with boosting erythropoietin production.Highlights Transcriptomics analysis of a
