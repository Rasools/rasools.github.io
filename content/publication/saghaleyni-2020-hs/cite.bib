 abstract = {Summary Higher eukaryotic cell lines like HEK293 are the
preferred hosts for production of therapeutic proteins requiring
human post translational processing. However, recombinant protein
production can result in severe stress on the cellular machinery,
resulting in limited titre and product quality. To investigate
the cellular and metabolic characteristics associated with these
limitations, we compared erythropoietin (secretory) and GFP
(non-secretory) protein producer HEK293 cell-lines using
transcriptomics analysis. Despite the high demand for ATP in all
protein producer clones, a significantly higher capacity for ATP
production was observed with erythropoietin producers as
evidenced by the enrichment of upregulated genes in the oxidative
phosphorylation pathway. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibited
specific patterns of expression depending on the recombinant
protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying a
dramatically increased erythropoietin secretion, we detected
higher ER stress, including upregulation of the ATF6B gene. Our
results are significant in recognizing key pathways for
recombinant protein production and identifying potential target
genes for further development of secretory power in mammalian
cell factories.In Brief Although the protein secretion process
has been widely studied, the complexity of it leaves many
questions with regards to defining bottlenecks for successful
protein secretion to be answered. By investigating the
transcriptomic profiles of different HEK293 clones with varying
translational rates producing either the secreted protein
erythropoietin or the intracellular GFP, we reveal that high ATP
production and improved capacity of specific post-translational
pathways are key factors associated with boosting erythropoietin
production.Highlights Transcriptomics analysis of a panel of
