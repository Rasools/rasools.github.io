  abstract = "Deregulation of the protein secretory pathway (PSP) is linked to
              many hallmarks of cancer, such as promoting tissue invasion and
              modulating cell-cell signaling. The collection of secreted
              proteins processed by the PSP, known as the secretome, is often
              studied due to its potential as a reservoir of tumor biomarkers.
              However, there has been less focus on the protein components of
              the secretory machinery itself. We therefore investigated the
              expression changes in secretory pathway components across many
              different cancer types. Specifically, we implemented a dual
              approach involving differential expression analysis and machine
              learning to identify PSP genes whose expression was associated
              with key tumor characteristics: mutation of p53, cancer status,
              and tumor stage. Eight different machine learning algorithms were
              included in the analysis to enable comparison between methods and
              to focus on signals that were robust to algorithm type. The
              machine learning approach was validated by identifying PSP genes
              known to be regulated by p53, and even outperformed the
              differential expression analysis approach. Among the different
              analysis methods and cancer types, the kinesin family members
              KIF20A and KIF23 were consistently among the top genes associated
              with malignant transformation or tumor stage. However, unlike
              most cancer types which exhibited elevated KIF20A expression that
              remained relatively constant across tumor stages, renal
              carcinomas displayed a more gradual increase that continued with
              increasing disease severity. Collectively, our study demonstrates
              the complementary nature of a combined differential expression
              and machine learning approach for analyzing gene expression data,
              and highlights key PSP components relevant to features of tumor
              pathophysiology that may constitute potential therapeutic
              targets.",

  abstract = "Summary Higher eukaryotic cell lines like HEK293 are the
              preferred hosts for production of therapeutic proteins requiring
              human post translational processing. However, recombinant protein
              production can result in severe stress on the cellular machinery,
              resulting in limited titre and product quality. To investigate
              the cellular and metabolic characteristics associated with these
              limitations, we compared erythropoietin (secretory) and GFP
              (non-secretory) protein producer HEK293 cell-lines using
              transcriptomics analysis. Despite the high demand for ATP in all
              protein producer clones, a significantly higher capacity for ATP
              production was observed with erythropoietin producers as
              evidenced by the enrichment of upregulated genes in the oxidative
              phosphorylation pathway. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibited
              specific patterns of expression depending on the recombinant
              protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying a
              dramatically increased erythropoietin secretion, we detected
              higher ER stress, including upregulation of the ATF6B gene. Our
              results are significant in recognizing key pathways for
              recombinant protein production and identifying potential target
              genes for further development of secretory power in mammalian
              cell factories.In Brief Although the protein secretion process
              has been widely studied, the complexity of it leaves many
              questions with regards to defining bottlenecks for successful
              protein secretion to be answered. By investigating the
              transcriptomic profiles of different HEK293 clones with varying
              translational rates producing either the secreted protein
              erythropoietin or the intracellular GFP, we reveal that high ATP
              production and improved capacity of specific post-translational
              pathways are key factors associated with boosting erythropoietin
              production.Highlights Transcriptomics analysis of a panel of
